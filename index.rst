HDF5 User Guide
===============
   The Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) implements a model for managing and storing data. The model includes an abstract data model and an abstract storage model (the data format), and libraries to implement the abstract model and to map the storage model to different storage mechanisms. The HDF5 Library provides a programming interface to a concrete implementation of the abstract models. The library also implements a model of data transfer, an efficient movement of data from one stored representation to another stored representation.
